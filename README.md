# Tech Blog: CMS-Style

## Description

Your challenge this week is to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers’ posts as well. You’ll build this site completely from scratch and deploy it to Heroku. Your app will follow the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

## Usage

To use the repo, navigate to the root folder, run the following commands from the CLI:

Seed DB;  
`npm run seed`

Start Server;  
`npm start server`

As a new user, you may need to install the proper packages in order to run the app. Please see below for that information.
